I have been accepted in [Google Summer of Code 2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008) program for working in a project of [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/). This summer I will be working to create a [Patient Note Writer](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Patient+Note+Writer+Module) module which will allow to add rich text observations in appropriate places/pages of the OpenMRS application. OpenMRS is an open source medical record system framework for developing countries. Its always nice to get accepted in programs like summer of code and its more nice to work for an Organization with a great cause. Another coincidence is that by profession I also work in software development related to the health care domain. So I am expecting an exciting summer with OpenMRS. I am also hoping to see OpenMRS deployed in Bangladesh in the future.
