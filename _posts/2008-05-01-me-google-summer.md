I have been accepted into the [Google Summer of Code 2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008) program to work on a project for [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/). This summer, I will be working to create a [Patient Note Writer](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Patient+Note+Writer+Module) module, which will allow adding rich text observations in appropriate places/pages of the OpenMRS application. OpenMRS is an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries. Getting accepted in programs like Summer of Code is always lovely, and working for an Organization with a great cause is even more exciting. So, I am expecting an exciting summer with OpenMRS. I am also hoping to see OpenMRS deployed in Bangladesh in the future.
