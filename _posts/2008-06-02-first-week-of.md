I didn't do much coding in first week. Rather it went after discussion of the exact requirement of Patient notes module which will result from my project. I tried to create an wiki page, which will be completed as per my project progress forward.

My module codes will reside here . Now I am trying to build an experimental module with the goals (given by my mentor Andreas) - add a tab to the patientDashboardForm.jsp (using
the extension point) which says something like 'Hello from '. Add a table indexed to patient id which has custom messages from each patient, so the display text could
change to ' says, '. Then adding an edit page for this message.
