I have bit sloppy in blogging in the first term of SOC. Hope this won't happen for the 2nd term and wish to write at least once for each week. Now I am mainly doing two things - working on writing a complex Obs handler for rich text. Secondly studying on Hibernate and javascript (I found some lackings of mine here). I couldn't make work the image upload thing in rich text editors. And after discussion with my mentor Andreas, I am only concentrating on rich texts now without image of any file upload. I have also updated the project wiki page with more or less these corresponding information.

I have planned to attend the Google SOC meet up at Google Bangalore office, fellow GSOCer Sri is also excited by knowing about my plan. But I am very sad that It seems I would not able to make it. I have to travel from Bangladesh to India for the meet up and the meet up date (28th July) is between the chunk of my two exam date (26th July and 30th July). As I thought to travel cheaply (by train), so it would take more than two days to reach Bangalore from Dhaka. I really wanted the India trip and sad that I missed it. So I decided to give a trip to India may be in August or just after the SOC ends.
