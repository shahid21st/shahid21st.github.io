Google Summer of code 2008 is come close to a finish. But I would feel I just started my journey through the Open Source path. I believe the true value of summer of code for a student is neither the project nor the money, but getting engaged with the open source community for coming years. Its a pleasure to work with the vibrant OpenMRS community and I hope to be with them in the future.

For those who are wondering, why I still don't announce an official release of my module - its because there is still some work in progress which I believe necessary before doing a release. Currently in [svn](http://svn.openmrs.org/openmrs-modules/patientnotes/) there is a working copy of note editor and anyone can try that. But before announcing about the project myself, I want to add the note type functionality using concept sets. Another point is that at last I have settled to use Fck Editor instead of Tiny MCE as it provides built-in file/image upload subsystem and more options.
