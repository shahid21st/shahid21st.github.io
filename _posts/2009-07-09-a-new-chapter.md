It\'s been a long since I last posted to this blog. From my last post to this post, many things are changed. I am married now. I am a student again. I left my job in March 2009 and started an MS by Research at Monash University Gippsland Campus at Churchill in Victoria, Australia. My nephew Fahad was born on 3rd June 2009; Micheal Jackson died a few days ago. So many things happened in the last couple of months.

It\'s pretty cold now here in Churchill. With the silent environment, except the occasional sound of passing cars, it feels colder than usual. The only exception is our smoke alarm, which constantly protests due to its weak batteries. But as the cold weather continues to get worse in the stance of our moral protest for warmer weather, we also ignore the urge to replace the smoke alarm battery - what an irony!

**Note:** Don\'t get alarmed. We eventually changed the battery a few days later.
