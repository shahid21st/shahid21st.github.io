It\'s been long since I last post to this blog. From my last post to this post, a lot of things are changed. I am married now. I am again back to studies. I left my job at March 2009 and started a MS by Research at Monash University Gippsland Campus at Churchill in Victoria, Australia. My nephew Fahad born at 3rd June 2009, Micheal Jackson died few days ago. So much happening in the last couple of months.

Its pretty cold now here in Churchill. With the silent environment except the occasional sound of passing of cars, it feels more colder. The only exception is our smoke alarm, it is constantly protesting due to its weak batteries. But as the cold weather continues to get worse in the stance of our moral protest for a warmer weather, we also just ignore the urge to replace the smoke alarm battery- what an irony!

Note: Don\'t get alarmed, we eventually changed the battery few days later.
