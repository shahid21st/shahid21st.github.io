I have participated in this year\'s [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2010). This was my second summer of code. This time, I am working on a project for [Mifos](http://mifos.org/) and my mentor is John Woodlock. Coincidentally, we both are currently living in Melbourne. I worked on a project to improve the separation of business logic from the presentation layer of the Mifos code base. You can check this GSOC [introduction](http://mifos.org/blog/meet-2010-google-summer-code-mifos-interns/) and [wrap-up](http://mifos.org/blog/summer-code-2010-journey-well-traveled/) posts in the Mifos blog.

I am excited that the project finished successfully, and there are three more reasons I am enjoying the success: 
- Mifos works with microfinance management, which is wide spread in Bangladesh and invented by our Noble laureate, [Dr. Yunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus).
- I could work in my comfort zone, i.e with Java and Spring technologies.
- It was challenging, as I had to juggle this project all through three months with my Master's thesis writing.
