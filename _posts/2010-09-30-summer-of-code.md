I have participated in this year\'s [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2010). This was my second summer of code. This time I am working on a project of [Mifos](http://mifos.org/) and my mentor is John Woodlock. Coincidentally we both are currently living in Melbourne. I worked on a project to improve the separation of business logic from the presentation layer of Mifos code base. You can check this GSOC [introduction](http://mifos.org/blog/meet-2010-google-summer-code-mifos-interns/) and [wrap-up](http://mifos.org/blog/summer-code-2010-journey-well-traveled/) posts in Mifos blog.

I am really excited that the project finished successfully and there are three more reasons I am really enjoying the success. First, Mifos works with micro finance management which is wide spread in Bangladesh and invented by our very own Noble laureate [Dr. Yunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus). Secondly, I could work in my comfort zone i.e with Java and Spring technologies. And finally, this was challenging as I had to juggle this project all through three months with my Masters thesis writing.
