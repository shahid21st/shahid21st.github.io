Well, \'Stop, Revive, Survive\' is a famous slogan used by the road safety authorities in Australia. But my post title has nothing to do with that. Instead, I want to mention this to announce that I have revived my blog, which has been dormant for quite some time. Well, many things changed in my life since the last post. The most notable is that I am the proud father of an almost 5-year-old boy, Yusha and a 4-month-old girl, Amina.

Before reviving, I gave some thought to the domain and hosting. Fortunately, I found a .au hosting with my name and bought it instantly. I thought to use WordPress or something like that, which can be installed by a click in any simple web hosting package. Previously, my blog was in Blogger, so I visited the blogger control panel after a long time and thought I needed more control of the blog. Also, the formatting and fiddling with rich text or HTML seems uncomfortable. I want something simple yet elegant and sophisticated. I found this dream combination true when I saw this blog [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) - it\'s a guide to creating a personal webpage/blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosting it for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I plan to do a detailed blog post after completing the project.

Next comes the survival part. Well, time will tell. But I plan to post here regularly. Topics would be related to technology, life and all.
