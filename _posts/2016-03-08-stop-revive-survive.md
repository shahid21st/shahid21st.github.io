Well, \'Stop, Revive, Survive\', this is a popular slogan used by the road safety authorities in Australia. But using this as my post title has nothing to do with that. Rather I just want to mention this to announce that I have revived my blog which is dormant for quite some time. Well a lot of thing changed in my life since the last post. I guess the most notable one is that I am the proud father of an almost 5 year old boy, Yusha and a 4 month old girl, Amina.

Before reviving I gave some thought about the domain and hosting. Fortunately found a .au hosting with my name and bought it instantly. I thought to use WordPress or something like that which can be installed by a click in any simple web hosting package. Previously my blog is in Blogger, so I visited the blogger control panel after a long time and I have an impression that I do not have full control of the blog. Also the formatting and fiddling with rich text or html seems uncomfortable to me. I want something simple, yet elegant and sophisticated. I think I found this dream combination to be true when I found this blog [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) - it\'s bascially a guide to create a personal webpage/blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosting it for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I planned to do detailed blog post soon as I complete the whole project.

Next comes the survival part. Well, time will tell. But I plan to post here regularly. Topics would be related to technology, life and all.
