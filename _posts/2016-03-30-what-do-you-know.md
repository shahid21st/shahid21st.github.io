I have been trying to overcome my public speaking fears for a while. So when I saw a call for speakers for [Web Directions'](http://www.webdirections.org/) *What Do You Know?* [event](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/wdyk-sydney-march-2016-tickets-21500385231), I thought I had to do this. At that time, I was fiddling with my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog quite a lot. So I shot a proposal to [Jhon Allsopp](https://www.webdirections.org/about/#john) about this, and he agreed.

So what is this *What Do You Know?* event is all about? From the event description:

> Back again for the first time in 2016, What Do You Know? brings you new, upcoming and seasoned speakers, talking about something they know well in a lightning 5 minutes.

So basically, it's a lightning talk series. I decided to cover some anecdotes regarding my attempts at blogging over the years and give a brief overview of blogging with Jekyll and hosting it on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I took a few days to prepare the slides (with the challenge of keeping everything within 5 minutes) and turned up on the day. There were a few more novice speakers like me and a few experienced ones. The event started with a good talk on public speaking by Sarah Ewen from [Public Speaking for Life](http://www.publicspeakingforlife.com.au/). Indeed, her speech helped to steady my nerves. I did okay; the starting was good, and then, in the last part, I mumbled a bit to finish everything in a hurry. Overall, it's an excellent experience and thanks to Web Directions for giving me the opportunity. You can find my slides from that night [here](https://github.com/shahid21st/WDYK-March-2016).
