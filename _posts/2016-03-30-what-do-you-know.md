I am actively trying to overcome my public speaking fears for a while. So when I saw a call for speakers for [Web Directions'](http://www.webdirections.org/) *What Do You Know?* [event](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/wdyk-sydney-march-2016-tickets-21500385231), I thought I had to do this. At that time, I was fiddling with my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog quite a lot. So I shoot a proposal to [Jhon Allsopp](https://www.webdirections.org/about/#john) about this and they agreed.

So what is this *What Do You Know?* event is all about? From the event description:

> Back again for the first time in 2016, What Do You Know? brings you new, upcoming and seasoned speakers, talking about something they know well, in a lightning 5 > minutes.

So basically it's a lightning talk series. I deicded to cover some annecdotes regarding my attempts at blogging over the years and give a brief overview of blogging with Jekyll and hosting it on [Github](https://github.com/). I took few days to prepare the slides (with the challenge of keeping everything within 5 minutes) and turned up on the day. It appeared there were a few more novice speakers like me and few experienced ones. The event started with a good talk on public speaking by Sarah Ewen from [Public Speaking for Life](http://www.publicspeakingforlife.com.au/), certainly her talk helped to steady my nerves a bit. I think I did okay, the starting was good, then in the last part I mumbled a bit to finishing everything in a hurry. Overall its a very good experience and thanks to Web Directions for giving me the opportunity. If you are inclined, you can find my slides from that night [here](https://github.com/shahid21st/WDYK-March-2016).
